# Catstronauts
Building a full-stack GraphQL example application called Catstronauts, a learning platform for adventurous cats who want to explore the universe! ðŸ˜º ðŸš€  The first feature we'll build for the app will fetch a (mocked) list of learning tracks from a GraphQL API and display them in a card grid on our homepage.
